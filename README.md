# Introduction to python programming
This repository is designed to guide new programmers through the first stages of learning how to code in Python.

I have focussed on using real world cases that provide useful results, and methods that could be easily used for other purposes.

The notebooks that are included should either be run in a local python environment, or else on Google Colab (which is easier for beginners).
